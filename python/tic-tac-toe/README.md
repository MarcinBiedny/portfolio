# python/tic-tac-toe

### What the project does

In this project, users can play tic-tac-toe game. The game is designed for two players who will alternately place the symbol O and X on the board drawn by the game. During the game, you must remember that Python counts rows and columns from 0, so cell numbering looks like this:

00 | 01 | 02<br>
10 | 11 | 12<br>
20 | 21 | 22

### Why the project is useful

During this project I got familiar with Object Oriented Programming and SOLID principle.
